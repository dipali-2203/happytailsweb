        <h3>We make sure your pets get the care they deserve</h3>
        <p>
          Happy Tails started with a simple idea: to give pet parents the power of tech to support everyday pet needs — all in one app.
          From scheduling to reminders and expert advice, our platform was built to simplify and elevate how you care for your furry family.
